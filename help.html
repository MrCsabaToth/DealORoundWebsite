          <p>In the bneginning on the first level you have <b>two minutes</b> to create poker hands.
             The <b>countdown</b> timer is located on the top left side of the game.</p>

          <h2>Selection</h2>
          <p>Poker hands can be created by two separate selection method:
            <ol>
              <li><p><b>"Swipe gesture mode"</b>: by pressing your finger on a card and dragging up, down, left or right
                (and depending on the mode and/or difficulty mode even laterally). You should not release your finger
                in this mode but until you want to finsh the selection, you should continuously keep moving your finger and
                selecting more cards.</p>
                <p>As you drag your finger the selected cards will dim yellow indicating that they have been selected.
                Releasing your finger causes the game to evaluate the hand.
                In certain difficulty modes and game levels a visual aid will highlight (with an orange dim) those neighboring
                cards which can be selected additionally.</p>
              </li>
              <li><p><b>"Clicking one-by-one"</b>: individually pressing your finger and releasing over the desired cards.
                The game intelligently recognizes that mode if you frist select a lonely card. If visual aid to highlight
                selectable neighbors, you can follow the orange dim to broaden the selection by clicking on orange cards,
                one-by-one.
                (If there's no visual aid, you just have to follow the rules to select proper neighbors. If you select a non
                neighboring card, a new selection begins with that card being the only selected.)</p>
                <p>You should press the "Eval" button to indicate the end of selection and that will also trigger the
                evaluation of the currently selected hand. In this mode the game cannot guess when your selection is done
                (as opposed to the swipe gesture mode). If you click on an already selected card it becomes unselected.
                This can be useful when you change your mind and you are exploring different poker possiblities.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            A hand can contain no more than 5 cards and all of the participating cards should contributes to the score,
            there are no outlier cards allowed.

          <h3>Neighbor highlighting</h3>
          <p>
            This is a visual aid which helps to indicate the rules of the game and can tremndously help the human eye
            to consider possible selections. The selected hand is dimmed yellow, while the potential selectable neighbors
            are dimmed orange.
          </p>
          <p>
            This aid is turned on for educational purposes on the first level of each difficulty mode. For further

          <h3>Diagonal selections</h3>
          <p>
            Being able to select diagonal neighbors can greatly increase the hand possiblities in case of
            square board layout. With hexagonal layout this question doesn't apply, because the diagonal
            neighbors are inherently side neighbors too.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for square layout easy mode, diagonal selection is allowed in all game levels, and in
            medium mode it is available for a while. For further details see <a href="#difficulty_modes">
